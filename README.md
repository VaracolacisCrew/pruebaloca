## INTRODUCTION
This is a little application to add much more functionality to the popular bluetooth Micro$oft numpad.

By removing the customization from the numpad itself and bring it to AHK it now can have unlimited profiles
controlled by a single key or conbination of keys (on the same numpad or any other input device) on top
of by application profiles.

Since the numpad itself has no way to display which profile it is on you can always review its profile on
the tray icon, or via a hotkey. It also shows a visual notification every time you switch profiles.
